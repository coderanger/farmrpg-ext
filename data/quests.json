    "text": "One of Lorn’s biggest regrets happened many years ago, far away from Redbrook. He was a soldier then, and he was sent with his battalion to free a group of people that were enslaved for many, many years.\n\nA dispatch was sent to the town ahead of the battalion to allow everyone time to gather. The slaveholders and the enslaved were assembled and waiting when the soldiers arrived. Lorn was given a proclamation to read to the town. The proclamation announced that those currently in the bondage of slavery were freed and would be treated as such. Lorn’s battalion remained in the area only long enough to make sure the proclamation was obeyed, and then they moved on to their next assignment.\n\nTo this day, Lorn worries that he didn’t do enough to help those newly freed people. He did his duty and followed his orders, but those newly freed men and women and children needed more than being released from forced labor. They needed kindness, friendship, and support.\n\nEvery year on this day, Lorn remembers. Then, he tries to find someone around him that needs a little more help and he reaches out to help.\n\nLorn would like everyone in town to join him in celebrating this day of freedom by helping others. Will you join him and remember someone that needs help?",

A few people were hurt and killed too.\n\n\nThat disaster from long ago was caused by a dragon. The destruction didn’t stop until a trio of dragon hunters arrived and hunted down the dragon. They killed it, but the dragon got one of the hunters and injured the other two.\n\n\nVincent would like to see a little less destruction this time. Will you help Vincent find the dragon and figure out a way to stop it? He’ll need some tools and resources.",

She begins to close her eyes and mumbles something incoherently. Stars’ attention is now riveted on the tower.\n\nA minute passes and nothing seems to be happening, and as you look to the tower, you can’t help but feel a little disappointed for Rosalie.\n\nAfter another minute, Star takes an appraising look at Rosalie and adjusts her stance slightly. Rosalie is so deeply in a trance; she doesn’t seem to notice at all. Star whispers something in Rosalie’s ear again, and her eyes open wide as she cries out:\n“LIBERO!!!!!!!”\n\nA rush of wind follows her words, and with a sound like peeling thunder and a giant flash, the tower is suddenly whole again!\n\nRosalie cries out in surprise, while Star exclaims “I KNEW IT!” and dances excitedly beside you both.\n\nAfter a few minutes of celebration, Star gently takes the staff back from a stunned Rosalie and offers it to you.\n\n\"This, this will stay with you. Hopefully, no one has need of it, but if they do, I know where to come. Keep it secret, keep it safe.\"\n\nStar hands Rosalie a second letter, and with a flourish and a thank you, he disappears without a trace (except feathers).

He has the biggest grin you have ever seen on a horse (not that you’re sure you’ve ever seen a horse grin before), and he appears to be having the time of his life. You ask Buddy how in the world the carousel is spinning, and he shows you the trench he dug with the tools you brought him. Water is flowing down the trench, and making the carousel turn. Buddy seems to be happy to have given Charles a fun ride to play on. He offers you a pile of coins, if you can bring something to carry it all in.",

He appears to be the organizer of this tournament. He announces that the tournament will consist of a series of rounds. Only the most competent teams will advance after each round. Round one will be held at Small Island!\n\nAll of the contestants then head out toward the fishing area. When you arrive, the cloaked figure yells “Begin!” and everyone rushes to a boat to start fishing.\n\nThomas tells you that this will be an easy round because he finally got his new fishing rod! The two of you begin to fish. You notice that the waters are rough. It won’t be as easy to fish as Thomas thinks.",

However, Lorn was told by the mayor, before that dinner with Ric, that he was going to end the work camp and relieve Ric of his duties.

The stranger noticed Captain Thomas standing in the gateway and said simply that he didn’t want to leave his trident behind, but the gateway wouldn’t let him take it to the new world.\n\nCaptain Thomas waited with the man. While they waited, Captain Thomas introduced himself. The stranger called himself Poseidon and said it was a pleasure to meet Captain Thomas. Then, Poseidon fell quiet again, seemingly deep in thought.\n\nEventually Poseidon spoke. He told Captain Thomas about some of his greatest adventures. Poseidon traveled to many worlds, but this was to be his last voyage for some time. Then, Poseidon talked about all the friends and family he made on his travels. He said he would continue to watch out for them, but they would wonder where he went. Finally, he asked Captain Thomas to find a new owner for his trident.\n\nCaptain Thomas agreed to find a worthy owner for the trident. Then, Captain Thomas attempted to shake Poseidon’s hand. The gateway prevented the contact.\n\nPoseidon thanked Captain Thomas and then released the trident. The gateway and Poseidon vanished. Captain Thomas was left there alone with the trident.\n\nWill you accept the responsibility of this mighty weapon? Will you also bring Captain Thomas a few things to create a memorial for Poseidon on the spot where the trident was left?",

You can meet her back at her home with Beatrix in a few days to avoid suspicion from Ric.

One day he was walking around the island with an orb of the glass that he made. He was looking to see if there were any reactions to the glass from other things on the island. Captain Thomas reached the eastern edge of the island a few minutes before the sun came up. As he was walking along the beach he reached down and pulled up a handful of sand. The excess sand falling from his hand stopped falling and remained in the air until the sun appeared. Then, the sand fell to the ground like normal.\n\nCaptain Thomas brought some of the western shore sand back to his shack and started experimenting. He discovered that this sand behaved very much like the sand near Thomas' shack, but only right before dawn. He also discovered that the two sands don't mix. They repel each other.\n\nWith this new knowledge, Captain Thomas went to explore the middle of the island. Just as he expected, Captain Thomas found that there is a line across the center of the island that is completely devoid of sand.\n\nCaptain Thomas would like to make some more glass using sand from both sides of the island. Will you help him get more resources for making glass?",

Trips into town have felt tense and you have intentionally avoided speaking to Beatrix and Rosalie except in passing. After gathering the items for tea, you arrive at Rosalie’s home, ready to discuss the letter and what has her so anxious with Beatrix.\nWhen you arrive, you’re surprised to find a third person sitting in a chair near Rosalie’s fireplace. Lorn greets you warmly and motions for you to join the group. Rosalie looks pensive, and Beatrix seems quiet and unreadable as ever. After sitting, the tense mood of the room becomes too much to bear, and Rosalie breaks the tension by suggesting tea.\nThe group prepare their tea, Beatrix adding some very odd ingredients to her tea in the process. After some time of small talk, the tension in the room again reaches palpable levels, and Lorn quietly draws the letter out of his pocket and says, “So, a peculiar gem?” Beatrix looks intently at Lorn, and for a moment, the fire seems to pulse in intensity, almost exactly at her pace of breathing, but you shake the feeling off as your imagination as Lorn continues, “I’ve heard many things about many various gems, but what do you all know about the power of gems?”\nRosalie blinks and gives Lorn an odd look, “Star hasn’t mentioned many things about gems, he seems to dislike a certain type, but I’ve never taken much notice to be honest.”\nBefore Lorn can reply, Beatrix in a crisp accent cuts him off, “Gems can hold many powers, they attune to the aether of the world, and some types have affinities towards elements and types of magic. For example, many of the elements attune to basic gems like rubies for fire, or emerald for earth. Using gems for magical enhancement is not a common art in the world any longer.”\nRosalie leans back looking surprised in her chair as what you now recognize as the voice of Geist speaks. Lorn takes a moment to process this information before continuing, “Indeed, I’ve heard similar stories about gems and magic, but there are some gems, some very peculiar, that seem to do things that defy a normal explanation.”\nThe fire in the room suddenly burns bright as Beatrix straightens and says, “I remember…fragments. A war! A gem! Pain! Loss…” \nSuddenly, Beatrix crumples to the ground as the fireplace loses intensity. Lorn and Rosalie rush to Beatrix’s aid. Her eyes open slightly, she looks directly at you and says, “I need rest…and the Flame Orb.”\nBeatrix closes her eyes, and Lorn asks you to gather some items to help Beatrix regain her strength.",

    "text": "The town is quiet as you gather the materials as quickly as you can, an even harsher reminder of how many townsfolk no longer call the town their home. On the trip back to Rosalie’s house, several times you notice certain oddities around town. A home door ajar, blinds closed with windows open - at one point you swear you saw shadows that seemed to move even when you stood still. Hairs standing on end, you attempt to look casual as you head towards your destination. The sense of unease does not lift when you enter the house, instead worry and uncertainty are etched upon the faces of your friends. \nLorn explains, “Beatrix needs more time to recover, but we’re worried that her instability could cause serious consequences if she were to transform in town. I suggest we bring her to your farm house before we give her the flame orb. Rosalie has volunteered to cast a spell of illusion on a cart that we can use to transport Beatrix back to your home with little suspicion.” \nRosalie looks at you strangely, “Did you know orange is a great color for illusions? The more it moves the more it stops the illusion from distorting my aether matrix. That said, Beatrix has a very unique aura owing to her unique circumstances, I’m going to need a lot more orange things than I normally would to make sure this spell works.”",

Lorn arrives and begins smoking a pipe, his presence of calm and serenity have an immediate soothing impact to your frayed nerves. Rosalie steps out of the other room, and upon seeing Lorn mentions how thankful she is to him for helping restock some of her other magic supplies.\n“On the contrary, our dear friend here found most of the goods for you, but I did add a little something special for you myself.” Lorn replies. He winks slyly to Rosalie before settling into a chair. \nAfter putting some tea on, Beatrix sits down and invites you all to listen to her tale. She puts a hand on the flame orb and the orb emits a searing light and the words seem to rush out of Beatrix. \n\n“Many years ago, dragons and humans lived in relative peace. Magic was abundant in the land, and tribes grew up around different wizarding traditions. I grew up in such a tribe, but I was not born with any magical talent myself. Our family was well known, and one day, a man came to our tribe asking for help from wizards. Only later did they find out that there was a war between humans and dragons, and before we knew it, the war descended upon our tribe too. \nThe wrath of the dragons was terrible, and despite my pleading with father, the wizarding tribes were upset at the slaughter of humans and fought back. Many, many dragons died, and many of my friends and family died too. During the worst of the fighting, a dragon soared overhead, pleading with everyone to stop fighting and I was caught up in their words. I followed the dragon many miles and found her pleading with her brethren to stop the fighting. Her words fell on deaf ears, but I was so encouraged that I revealed myself to her and that is how Geist and I became comrades. We rushed to another battlefield to plead to stop the fighting, but it fell on deaf ears. In the fighting, Geist was wounded by a mage who held strange powers, and in my grief I screamed and shouted for the fighting to stop, but it never did… they wouldn’t stop fighting. They wouldn’t listen! In that moment, I lost all hope for humanity and dragonkind and laid beside Geist, waiting for the death of the battlefield I knew was inevitable.”\nBeatrix is now openly crying and Lorn puts a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. \nLorn suggests you take a few minutes to let Beatrix regain her composure, and through tears, Beatrix suggests Geist tell you the rest of the story. She asks for some surf and turf, because she’ll likely be hungry anyways, and asks you all to step outside.",

The eggs were similar in size and heft to normal chicken eggs, but they were decorated with colors and designs. The eggs also seemed to be completely indestructible, at least the one Vincent saw couldn’t be cracked.\n\nThese decorated eggs always appeared in the early spring, and many of the legends said there were only 12 eggs that could be found. When spring ended, the eggs vanished until the following year. Then, the eggs reappeared, hidden in new locations.\n\nA few of the legends spoke of a 13th golden egg that held vast powers or wealth or something like that. No one ever found the 13th egg in any of the stories.\n\nVincent would like you to keep an eye out this spring for mysteriously decorated eggs in strange places. If the two of you can find the 12 springtime eggs, maybe you can find the golden egg too. Vincent would be happy to evenly split any profit that could be made from the golden egg.\n\nIf you’re interested, just bring any strange eggs you find to Vincent to prove and secure.",

Rest assured that she is well and unharmed. This has been a traumatic several weeks for her, and I hope to ease her pain by telling you the rest of our story. I know you don't know me, but I know you all very well, as well as Beatrix herself does. Our shared memories make you all so familiar to me, I apologize if I address you all as if I've known you for years, because, you see, I have.\n\nIn that moment, so long ago, when Beatrix laid herself down beside me, I wept for the state of the world, for the wars and hatred that even I did not understand. To see so small a human laid low in empathy broke my heart, and it was in that moment of sadness and desperation to not see the world torn apart that something deep inside me changed. As I bled out from my strange wound, I blacked out, and when I came to, I was not me, but I was a part of Beatrix, and she was a part of me.\n\nWe eventually learned that only one of us could manifest at once, and through our experiences, Beatrix became so despondent that the only thing I could do for my dear friend was lock our memories away and give her a fresh start in a small village to live our life as normal as possible.\n\nI tell you this, because I believe the injustices we have seen Ric impose on our small town are as cruel as we have ever witnessed, and we know the loss and pain of friend and family. I want to help so I offer you this, the knowledge I have of the peculiar gem. Indeed, I have heard of it and I know it has power that neither Beatrix nor I understand. It seems crucial to understand why Star might have mentioned it now, and together we should seek this item out.”\n\nThe group stands around for a moment, deep in thought, when Lorn breaks the silence, “I have heard of this peculiar gem from travelers before, passed down by generations, its value incalculable to anyone. It seems to me the best path forward would be to speak with our resident collector, Cecil, mayhap he has heard of this gem, or has acquired it himself? I have no other leads to offer at this time, unfortunately.”\nEveryone agrees this seems like a reasonable first step, and the group decide it best to bring Cecil an offering of goodwill, knowing he is more open to talking about his collection when he’s adding to it.",

    "text": "As a group, it is decided that you and Rosalie are best suited to see Cecil, so you head off to town with your goods, and make your way through town. Cecil’s house is an oddity, older than many other homes in the town, but it has always seemed to come through tragedy untouched and looking quite pristine.\n\nRosalie knocks on Cecil’s door and at first, there is no answer. A few moments later, the large front door opens slowly, and Cecil appears with an annoyed look on his face. His eyes quickly flit to Rosalie and before she says anything, he looks to you and says quietly, “You may enter. The mage’s pupil is not allowed in under any circumstance. These are my terms.” His eyes look like they will brook no argument and Rosalie gives you a quizzical look before stepping away from the door.\n\nCecil opens the door wider and allows you inside. The majesty and size of his home is not lost on you in that moment, as the door opens to a great hallway full of trinkets and baubles that distract the eye and glitter in unique and fascinating ways. Cecil walks you to a room you’ve never been in before and your eyes are drawn to even more trinkets and the energy core you brought back from Romuska, placed on a mantle in a base overseeing the room. You notice a kind of black cord coming down the side of the mantle but before you can figure out where it goes, Cecil interrupts your reverie by coughing gently.\n\n“I know why you’re here, and I need your help. You see, Ric has been asking me for more and more money lately to fund his operation. Obviously, money is easy to come by, but I need to replenish my collection of items I sell to various vendors. In return, I will tell you what I know.”\n\nYou see no other avenue forward, and Cecil hands you a list of items he wants you to acquire. It’s strangely similar to items Rosalie and Star have asked you for in the past.",

The eggs started glowing a soft green, but turned red again when he put the plate down.\n\nVincent picked the plate up again and started walking outside.

Vincent immediately stopped and sat down with the eggs while he waited for his eyes to readjust after the flash. When he finally looked around, Vincent saw something shiny in a knot of grass. It was the golden egg!\n\nThe decorated eggs stopped glowing after that flash, and nothing more happened when Vincent added the golden egg to the plate of decorated eggs. Whatever magic was at work in the eggs seems to be at rest now.\n\nNow, Vincent doesn’t know what to do with the eggs. He would love to make some money from them, but he feels like it isn’t really earned for his part. He’s also plenty satisfied just seeing legends he heard come to life.\n\nVincent thinks you should take the eggs.

If you wouldn’t mind, a double deposit, just to keep the town running smoothly and the guard paid, would be ever so appreciated.”",

This money will be extremely useful in the coming days to make safe the townsfolk all over this area. I see you still plan on visiting other townsfolk, well, if you want my advice, don’t trust anyone that won’t give you anything you want immediately.”\n\nYou leave, Ric’s words echoing in your ears. You decide the best approach is to talk to some of the townsfolk you are better acquainted with, and approach George’s home.\n\nAs luck would have it, George is sitting on his porch playing guitar and singing a song, you pause to listen before approaching him.\n\n“I’d give anything\n\nTo be where you’re at\n\nI’d do anything\n\nTo become what you are\n\nIt’s too late\n\nI don’t have what it takes\n\nI don’t have it\n\nI don’t have it\n\nSo move on\n\nI’m alright\n\nI need to move on now\n\nCause I’m gonna be alright”\n\nThe melody catches your ear, haunting but pleasant. There’s a strange comfort in the words, and you give George a moment to finish his song before you approach him any further.\n\nAfter handing him the gift basket, you ask him about Cecil and any strange occurrences in the town, and George shakes his head, he’s been focused on his music lately and hasn’t paid too much attention to more than he’s had to do for Ric, which are just standard dragon defense tactics. You thank George for his time and offer your thanks for the song.",

Thomas ushers you down a side street towards his home. After a few moments, you regain your composure enough to assure Thomas that you are fine and ask him about Cecil and strange happenings.\n\nThomas gives you a second strange look and breaks out in a belly laugh. “Oh, do you mean besides the dragon attack? Or Ric Ryph? Or perhaps you mean the fact that *I caught all these fish?!*” Thomas proudly shows you a drying rack with three trout.\n\n“Fished ‘em myself! Maybe I’m not a lost cause afterall, eh?”",

Beatrix started to dismiss the thought, but it came again, and it felt so comfortable. So, she poured a bit of the grape juice on her very freshly sprouted radishes. Instantly, the radish stems and leaves elongated to their full-grown height.\n\nBeatrix carefully pulled a radish from the ground and examined it. The radish was fully grown and perfectly ripe! Beatrix couldn’t believe it. She pulled the rest of the radishes and all were alike, ripe and fully grown.\n\nBeatrix is now tangled in curiosity. She wants to know more about this phenomenon.

As a fellow seller of fine goods, Borgen could relate. So, he reluctantly parted with some of his ancient coins to purchase the entire bin of fruit.\n\nNow, according to the farmer, these peaches should be reaching the peak of ripeness in the next day or so. As they do, Borgen would like to get this new fruit out to several people to test the potential market for these “Peaches of the Unincorporated Southern Arcagos”.\n\nWould you like to try a peach?

Holger suspects that Borgen didn’t even know the map was jammed inside the model.

He suspects that the entrance squiggles require a legend, or key of some sort, that isn’t on the map.\n\nSince no solutions were presenting themselves, Holger hiked all over the area looking for anything that might be a clue. He was hoping that he would see something that might shake an idea loose in his brain and help him decipher those squiggles. Eventually, he ended up at the Exchange Center and started talking to Lorn about the map.\n\nAs Holger was drawing out some of the squiggles, Lorn had an epiphany. Lorn saw a coin once with very similar markings to one of the groups of squiggles. At first, Lorn thought he had one of the coins in the exchange center storeroom, but after searching for several minutes he couldn’t find a coin that matched what he remembered.\n\nSince Lorn couldn’t find the coin, he tried to do a simple drawing of it. Holger has a general idea of what he’s looking for now. If you happen to come across a coin with a skull on it, will you bring it to Holger?",

Maybe that’s the place on this map.

After he returned from talking to Vincent, he noticed that the backside of the runestone, that you found, was similar to the squiggles on the southern entrance on the map. So, he put the runestone face down on the map and lined it up with the squiggles. It fit perfectly! It also had a reaction like the coin, where it resists being removed from the map. Strangely, that resistance doesn’t happen with the runestone face up.\n\nIt took Holger a little while to recognize the image created by the runestone and the map, but he’s pretty sure that it’s the small cave not far from Lake Tempest.\n\nNow, Holger wants to go explore the small cave and see if the map is correct. Will you help him prepare for exploring the cave?",

Holger would have continued, but Buddy seemed adamant.\n\nWhile Holger was consulting the map to figure out a different path, Buddy warned Holger about pursuing any other options. Buddy explained that all of the tunnel entrances are lined with traps, very deadly ones. He also said that he had a tool to disable the traps, but that the pirate magic powering the traps has weakened over the years. Without stabilizing the pirate magic, the shutoff mechanism wouldn’t work.\n\nBuddy suggested that Holger find a load of pirate artifacts and bring them to the cave. The artifacts will still have a little pirate magic in them that can be accumulated together and shared with the trap mechanisms. Then, Buddy can turn off the traps and let Holger through the tunnels.\n\nWill you help Holger gather up old pirate artifacts?",
